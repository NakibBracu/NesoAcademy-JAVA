Assignment Operator
Using "="
-lvalue=rvalue
-lvalue should be a variable
-rvalue is an expression that evaluates to a value
-rvalue is evaluated and then restored to lvalue
//examples
int x = 1+99;
here x is a variable and 1+99 is an expression.
//we can assign multiple variables in the same statement:
example-
int y;
int x=y=4+1;
*** Assignment Statements(Statements that evaluate an expression and assign the result to a variable)
int i = 5;
double d = 5.0;
int i2 = 10;
i2 = i2+10;
***Assignment Expression
Each assignment statement is an assignment expression
double d ;
int i1,i2;
System.out.println(d=5.0);
System.out.println(i1=3);
***Augmented Assignment Operator
int i1 = 1
i1 = i1+1;
i1+=1;
//example-2
int i1 = 2;
i1*=5+1---> means i1 = i1 * (5+1);//12
if we write i1 = i1*5+1 //this is wrong and the answer will be 11
