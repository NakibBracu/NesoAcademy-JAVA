break and continue are special keywords used within loops
--->>>>break
exits the loop regardless of the condition
--->>>>continue
skips the rest of the loop's body.Continue exeucuting the loop as if we finished executing the body.
---> for loop: execute change
--->while & do while loops: check condition
example using continue to print odd numbers between 1 to 10.
for(int i=1;i<=10;i++){
if(i%2==0)// if i is even then i++ happened
continue;
System.out.println(i+" ");
}
//enter a number between 1 to 10
int n;
while(true){
   System.out.print("Enter a number between 1 t0 10 : ");
    n = sc.nextInt();
    if(n<1 || n>10)
    continue;
    System.out.println(n+" is between 1 to 10");
    break; 	
}
//the following loop will be executing until user donot input number between 1 to 10
//same code can be written like this;cause n is defined outside the loop.
int n;
while(true){
   System.out.print("Enter a number between 1 t0 10 : ");
    n = sc.nextInt();
    if(n<1 || n>10)
    continue;
    
    break; 	
}
System.out.println(n+" is between 1 to 10");
//but if n is defined inside the loop the following code will give us error.See the code below
while(true){
   System.out.print("Enter a number between 1 t0 10 : ");
    int n = sc.nextInt();
    if(n<1 || n>10)
    continue;
    
    break; 	
}
System.out.println(n+" is between 1 to 10");//error
