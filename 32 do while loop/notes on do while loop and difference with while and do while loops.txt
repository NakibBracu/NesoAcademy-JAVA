do while loop structure
//as long as the boolean-expression is true the loop will be executed
//do-while is executed at least once
********for single statement
do
  statement
 while(boolean-expression);
******for multiple statement(s)
do{
  statement(s)
 while(boolean-expression);
 }
 //example where first iteration is happening without checking its condition
 int i = 1;
 do{
   System.out.println("Hello "+i);
 }while(i<=3);
 ***Difference between while and do-while
 while: check the condition then execution
 do while: executed first then checking condition and running as long as the boolean-expression is true
 ////example
 int i = 100 //i<=5 is false
 while(i<=5){
  System.out.println("Hello "+i);
  i++;
 }
 the loop shown above will never be executed
 //example 
 int i = 100 //i<=5 is false
 do{
 System.out.println("Hello "+i);
  i++;
 }while(i<=5);
