constant values cannot be changed
we use final keyword for constant
-it can be used like any other variable
-Normally constant case are written in uppercase
we can also use snake case convention for writing constant(use underscores)
syntax error will be shown if we try to change the value of constant

final String Company_Name = "Neso Academy";
