immutable objects are those objects whose contents can't be changed
-A constant is a variable whose value can't changed
-An immutable object is a object whose contents can't be changed
-Immutable objects are created from immutable classes
-The String class in java is immutable.So, the contents of String objects can't be changed.
String str = "OLD VALUE";
str = "NEW VALUE";
We are thinking that "OLD VALUE" is replaced by "NEW VALUE" but there is nothing happen like that. "OLD VALUE" will be removed by Java Garbage Collector;
and str reference "NEW VALUE"
********************************
Using new with Strings
Strings are immutable-> no need to use new
-We would want to use new because it allows us to create a seperate object that references a seperate value.
-When working with Strings this is not needed because the original String will not be modified because Strings are immutable 
String str1 = "VALUE 1";// str1----------->"VALUE 1"
String str2 = str1;// str1,str2------------>"VALUE 1"
str2 = "VALUE 2";//str 1--------->"VALUE 1";
str 2--------->"VALUE 2" ;
//always use = with Strings;
