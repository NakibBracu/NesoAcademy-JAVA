*****Addition operator
+
int x = 1+3;
System.out.println("The sum is "+(1+3));
the output of the above line will be The sum is 4
System.out.println("The sum is "+1+3);
the output of the above line will be The sum is 13
*****Subtraction Operator
-
int y = 4-3;
System.out.println("The diff is "+(4-3));
the output of the above line will be The diff is 1
System.out.println("The diff is "+4-3);
the output of the above line will be an error 4 is concatanating with The diff is  but then it cannot subtract a string and integer
*****Multiplication Operator
*- it works without paranthesis
int x = 3*2;
System.out.println("The product is "+(4*3));
//output will be The product is 12
System.out.println("The product is "+4*3);
//output will be The product is 12
*****Division Operator
/-it works without paranthesis
int x = 6/2;
System.out.println("The division is "+(12/4));
//output is The division is 3
System.out.println("The division is "+12/4);
//output is The division is 3
(int/int)=int
(double/double)=double;
(int/double)=double;(implicit casting)
******Modulo Operator(remainder of division)
%-it works without paranthesis
it works with remainder
4%2 =0;
5%2=1;
System.out.println("The remainder is "+(12%4));
//output is The division is 0
System.out.println("The division is "+12%4);
//output is The division is 0
paranthesis--->multiplication----->addition---------->substraction
example
2*(1+7)-12/(4+2)
--->simulation
2*8-12/6(same precidence left to right)
16-2
14
