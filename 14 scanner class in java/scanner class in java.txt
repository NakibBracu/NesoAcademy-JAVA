Hello NAME
public static void main (String [] args){
String userName = "Abrar";
System.out.println("Hello"+userName);
}
creating a variable of type Scanner
ex-
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
//in is a filed of System class; it is static
****Methods to read different types of input from user
input.next();//Read a String
input.nextInt();//Read an integer
input.nextDouble();//Read a double
there are more such as 
.nextByte();
.nextShort();
.nextLong();
.nextFloat();
.nextBoolean();
When one of these methods is called the programs will pause execution and wait for the user to enter a value will be returned by these methods.
note:- we don't have .nextChar();
code example
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println(input.next());
but it only reads the before first space word
System.out.println(input.nextLine());
the code shown above reads the whole line
