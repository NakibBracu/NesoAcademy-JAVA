Primitive types are the types that holds simple values
ex- byte,short,int,long,float,double and char
the variable contanis the value
this primitive types values stored in a memory that has specific addresses
types that hold complex values(Objects)
String is a reference types (box inside the box)
ex-
String s = "Hello";
the way Hello is restored in memory is String s has a box where many objects is restored in different addresses and Hello will find the empty address and stored there
In a easy way the variable contains the address of the value
The variable references the value thats why its called reference types
in primitive data types all works like box
but in reference data types they works like saving the addresses
