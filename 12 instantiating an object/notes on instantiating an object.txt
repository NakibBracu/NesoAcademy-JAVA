ClassName objectName = new ClassName(Parameters);
//ClassName(Parameters) is a special method call constructor
Point point = new Point(1,2);
Cat tom = new Cat("Tom");
***instantiating a String Object
String name1 = "Akash";
String name2 = new String("Akash");
both the code works java makes easy to work flexibly with String
thats why we can use it like primitive data types
if we don't use the new keyword our object reference the same value and if we do so the new variable takes new space for that
ex-
String name1 = "Akash";-----(i)
String name2 = "Akash";-----(ii)
String name3 = new String("Akash");------(iii)
for (i) & (ii) the thing works like references
but for (iii) it works like primitive data types.
