Casting(Converting a Data Type to Another Type)
****Implicit Casting
-> Happens automatically when converting from a narrower rangs to a wider range ex- int---->double/float/long
ex-> float to double
---------->ex->
double d1 = 4;(int to double)
double d2 = 5.7f;(float to double)
long l1 = 100;(int to long)
//Error(Wider-> Narrower(not possible in implicit casting))
int i1 = 4.5;
int i2 = 8L;
float f1 = 4.5;
****Explicit Casting
-> Doesn't Happen automatically .Should be done by the programmer
when converting Wider to Narrower
ex-> double to int
ex-> Long to Double
//(new data type) expression
int i1 = (int) 4.5; (data loss .5)
int i2 = (int) 8L;
float f2 = (float) 4.5;(4.5->4.5f)
note
int i1 = 4.5;
error
int i1 = (int) 4.5;//error solve
ex-2
double d1 = 4.5+3;
(3 will be automatically casted to 3.0)
it is called explicit casting
example
double d = 4.2;
int i1 = (int)d;
explicit casting;
// here d = 4.2 and i1 = 4;
